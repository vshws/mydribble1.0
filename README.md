## Overview

This project is a React-based clone of Dribbble, a popular platform for showcasing creative work and portfolios. It aims to replicate key features and design elements of Dribbble's interface while leveraging modern web development technologies.

**Key Features Implemented:**

- **Project Showcase:** Displays a collection of projects in a grid layout, each showcasing project details such as name, team, likes, and views.
- **Navigation:** Includes a navigation bar with links to different sections like Inspiration, Find Work, Learn Design, etc.
- **Filtering:** Provides filtering options to categorize projects based on tags or categories.
- **Responsive Design:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS for responsive styling, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive Elements:** Integrates interactive components like dropdown menus and buttons for user interaction.

This clone project serves as a practical exercise in frontend development, demonstrating proficiency in React, Tailwind CSS, and UI/UX design principles. It provides a scalable foundation for expanding functionalities and customizing features inspired by Dribbble's platform.



## Features

- Grid layout displaying projects dynamically fetched from a data array.
- Project cards with image, name, team, likes, and views.
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-project-showcase.git

# Usage

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
